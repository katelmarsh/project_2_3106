Cleaned and inserted the data into firm’s SQL database.* Built a custom valuation system for different patent categories and implemented gradient boosting, neural network, decision tree, RNN and LSTM methods to predict patent value with 95% fit.* Implemented generative adversarial networks to generate statistically similar synthetic data for sample size increase. PROJECTSKaggle Project for COVID-19 Diagnosis from Pneumonia Cases’ Chest X-Rays* Used the Keras ImageDataGenerator to resize the image to 224x224x3 and applied various image augmentations (zooms, horizontal flips, width shifts, height shifts, brightness changes, rotations) to detect virus particles.* Applied transfer learning and fine tuned large pre-trained CNNs such as DenseNet and concluded that ~85% accuracy was the best a single CNN could perform. * Combined transfer learning with Ensembling and finetuned 10 large pre-trained networks like VGG16, DenseNet121, DenseNet169 and ResNet50 and recorded prediction probabilities from each model. I averaged the probabilities for each sample to get the "group-voted-best answer", which improved the generalization of my final predictions. Data Science Consulting project for Retail Clients                                                                                          * Built a monthly report for retail clients based on their customers’ data, customers’ use of retail websites and purchases made. Analyzed popular products and targeted valuable customers, and communicated with product managers based on the results for decision making of next season stock-up.* Created a user-interactive website using Shiny for target selection and dynamic graphic illustration.
